Emacs Crap for C++

This is a very preliminary hodgepodge of elisp to help work on C++
projects that have a compile_commands.json file.  Many other tools
exist that are more advanced; it's mostly just to learn elisp better,
as well as the functionality that clang provides to build development
tools.
